# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

This web application was developed for the integration and illustration of multiple features in JavaScript by putting into action an interactive functional game version for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
This project involves implementing event handling and dynamically updating the DOM within a responsive web application. It serves as a practical demonstration of how these JavaScript features can work together to create a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

##Features of the site.

## Testing

When testing this game I performed all testing steps for all screen sizes.

     - I clicked one choice multiple times to make sure the results were true and displayed the correct message and the score incresed properly and by the right ammount.

     - I repeated this step with all other options to be clicked to make sure the results are consistant and there are no issue when selectiong one option to another.

     - I opened and closed the rules multiple times to make sure they pop up in the same spot and that the open and close feature works consistently.

     - I refereshed the page multiple time to ensure the changing icon is working as intended.

# Fixes

Bug Fixes:

     1. issue #1: There was an issue at the start of my java script code where all of a sudden after fixing a few spelling errors on my html where the java script stopped working.
         - I fixed the issue by looking over my work and figured out that i misspelled the file name for script.js (I entered sript.js)

     2. issue #2: After creating the getResults function and testing the game after wards i realised that the results wouldnt update when you get a draw till you either get a win or loss then the score would update.
         - To fix the issue i read through all my code and realised i made a spelling error. i then fixed my error and the code worked smoothly.

I deployed the site using Github pages:

  1. Within the GitHub repository, select the settings tab,
  2. Under the "code and automation" tab, select "pages".
  3. Make sure you,
     - Set the source to "Deploy from branch",
     - Select "main branch"
     - Set folder to "Root"
     - Click "Save"

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
